## Next Steps for Your Personal Website

- [ ] **Review and Customize Content**:
    - [ ] Go through `src/components/About.js`, `src/components/Projects.js`, `src/components/Skills.js`, `src/components/Resume.js`, and `src/components/Contact.js`.
    - [ ] Replace the placeholder text with your actual information, project details, skills, and contact links.
    - [ ] **Important**: In `src/components/Resume.js`, update the `href` for the resume download button to point to your actual PDF resume file. You'll need to place your resume PDF in the `public` folder (e.g., `public/SladeRose_Resume.pdf`) and then update the link to `/SladeRose_Resume.pdf`.
    - [ ] **Important**: In `src/components/Contact.js`, update the `mailto` link with your email and the LinkedIn/GitHub links with your actual profiles.

- [ ] **Add More Styling and Refine Animations**:
    - [ ] The current styling in `src/App.css` is very basic. You can expand on it to match your desired aesthetic.
    - [ ] Experiment with `framer-motion` properties to create more engaging animations.

- [ ] **Run the Development Server**:
    - [ ] To see your changes locally, open your terminal in the `/Users/sladerose/Desktop/sladerose/` directory and run:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    - [ ] This will open your website in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

- [ ] **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
    - [ ] Once you are satisfied with your website, you'll need to:
        - [ ] **Create a GitHub Repository**: If you haven't already, create a new public repository named `Pages` under your GitHub account (`sladerose`).
        - [ ] **Push your code**: Initialize a git repository in your project folder (if not already done by `create-react-app`), commit your changes, and push them to your GitHub repository.
        - [ ] **Deploy**: In your terminal, run:
            ```bash
            npm run deploy
            ```
            This command will build your React app and push it to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository. Your site should then be accessible at `https://sladerose.github.io/Pages`.
